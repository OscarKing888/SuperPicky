# SuperPicky Cursor Rules

Follow `scripts_dev/AI_CODING_RULES.md`.

## Non-negotiable

- Use UTF-8 and avoid Chinese mojibake.
- For ExifTool non-ASCII metadata writes, use UTF-8 temp-file redirect (`-Tag<=file`) instead of inline command value.
- Preserve Windows + macOS compatibility in file paths and subprocess usage.
- Ensure persistent processes are closed cleanly and idempotently.
- For packaged-only CUDA errors, diagnose packaging/runtime first.
- Keep Torch/CUDA Windows packaging with UPX disabled unless explicitly validated.

## Validation

- Run `py -3 -m py_compile` for changed Python files.
- Validate metadata write/read-back when touching EXIF logic.
- Run packaged-app smoke test when changing `.spec` or packaging logic.
